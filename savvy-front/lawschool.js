      "Dr Karanasiou’s research focusses on the relationship between Law and Emerging Technologies and falls within three general lines of work:  1. Data Governance, 2. Legal Tech and law computability, and 3. Regulating mixed interfaces (Human-Computer Interactions). Al. Argyro’s work is contributing to the growing body of ‘law and emerging technologies’ transdisciplinary scholarship and has earned her visiting research affiliations with Yale Law School (ISP Alumna), NYU Law (ILI Alumna), Harvard Law (affiliate Faculty staff CopyX), Complutense Madrid (ITC). Her research spans a wide range of areas ranging from wearable tech and regulation of health data to Brain-Machine-Interfaces and embodiment, which all share a common underlying theme of re-conceptualisation of autonomy in an era of rapid automation.",
